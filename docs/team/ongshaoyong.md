## Overview
myReviews is a desktop application allowing users to save and rate movies and TV shows that they
have watched. myReviews is fully written in Java, and users can interact with the application using
Command Line Interface (CLI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Summary of Contributions
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add new Movies and TV shows to the saved list.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add movies or TV show reviews, differentiated by the format of the command given.
(/movie or /tv)
  * Justification: This feature is one of the most fundamental, allowing users to add movies/TV shows to their saved 
list. Other information including genre, rating, date watched and site to stream the show can also be added to the list
with this feature.
  * Highlights: This is a vital feature as it is the most basic ability on the application, allowing users to add to their
list. The key challenges was handling errant commands, including those with illegal characters and words that interfered
with the storage function and preventing users from properly saving their lists.
