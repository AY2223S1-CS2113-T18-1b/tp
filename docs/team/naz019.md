## Overview
myReviews is a desktop application allowing users to save and rate movies and TV shows that they
have watched. myReviews is fully written in Java, and users can interact with the application using
Command Line Interface (CLI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Summary of Contributions
* **New Feature**: Sorting the review list
  * What it does: This feature allows the user to sort the review list by a given field, namely `rating`, `title`, 
`date` and `genre`.
  * Justification: By sorting the review list according to the user's preferences, the review list becomes more than 
just a recording of movies the user has watched, since the user can now glean valuable information from an ordered list. 
For example, with just a single command, the user can easily see the most personally highly-rated movies and TV shows, 
so that comparisons in genres can be made to determine the user's genre preferences.
  * Highlights: The default sorting order for every possible field has been customized to give the most intuitive
ordering for the user. Once the review list has been sorted, it is also displayed to the user as movies and TV shows 
separately so that the user can more easily analyze the sorted list by media type.

review as favourite if it has already been marked.
